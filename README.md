<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.16.567242v1>

The code will generate the figures from the manuscript. The repo is organised
into folders, each of which contain data and code to generate one of the
figures. 

To run the code on your machine first clone the repo i.e.

```
git clone https://github.com/FEGraf/CHL_Malawi_test2
```
On mac and linux.

Then navigate to the directory corresponding to the analysis you want to and run
the script there which will generate the figure.

The co-occurance analysis is wrapped in an Rmarkdown document, which, when
rendered will reproduce the analysis and figures from the manuscript.
